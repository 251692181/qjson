Installing QJson
--------------

QJson requires:
- Qt 4.0 or greater
- cmake 2.6 or greater

For Unix/Linux/Mac:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=_preferred_path_ ..
  make
  make install
  /sbin/ldconfig, if necessary

Some possible cmake options:
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
   that enables the some debug output (other than making easier to debug the code)
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/testinstall
   install qjson in a custom directory
 -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=${HOME}/testinstall/include
   include a custom include directory            
 -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/testinstall/lib    
   include a custom library directory            
 -DLIB_DESTINATION=lib64                                                          
   if you have a 64 bit system with separate libraries for 64 bit libraries  
 -DQJSON_VERBOSE_DEBUG_OUTPUT:BOOL=ON                        
   more debugging statements are generated by the parser. It's useful only if you are trying to fix the bison grammar.
