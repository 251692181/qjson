Installing QJson
--------------

QJson requires:
- Qt 4.0 or greater
- cmake 2.6 or greater

Some possible cmake options:
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
   enables some debug output (other than making easier to debug the code)
 -DQJSON_BUILD_TESTS=yes or -DKDE4_BUILD_TESTS=yes
   builds the unit tests
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/testinstall
   install qjson in a custom directory
 -DCMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=${HOME}/testinstall/include
   include a custom include directory            
 -DCMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/testinstall/lib    
   include a custom library directory            
 -DLIB_DESTINATION=lib64                                                          
   if you have a 64 bit system with separate libraries for 64 bit libraries  
 -DQJSON_VERBOSE_DEBUG_OUTPUT:BOOL=ON                        
   more debugging statements are generated by the parser. It's useful only if you are trying to fix the bison grammar.

For Unix/Linux/Mac:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=_preferred_path_ ..
  make
  make install
  /sbin/ldconfig, if necessary

For Symbian:
  General instructions:
  Use latest symbian/qt libraries (4.6.2 at this time). Also you should have most uptodate compiler (build 487 or newer) when compiling on symbian. You can
  download a patch for Carbide/Qtcreator compiler (emulator compiler) from http://pepper.troll.no/s60prereleases/patches/x86Tools_3.2.5_Symbian_b487.zip 
  (unzip to C:\Program Files\Nokia\Carbide.c++ v2.0\x86Build\Symbian_Tools\Command_Line_Tools) and if you are working with 3.1 device download this also
  http://pepper.troll.no/s60prereleases/patches/getexports.exe (unzip it tp epoc32\tools\)

  Build exports public qjson headers to epoc32\include for use with your application.
  Dll capabililies are set by default to "TARGET.CAPABILITY = ReadDeviceData WriteDeviceData" src.pro adjust to your needs. You might need to tweak this according to your app.
  By default dll def file is not generated and abi is not freezed (hence symbian:MMP_RULES += "EXPORTUNFROZEN" is used)

  Detailed build instructions:
  cd <qjson root, same level as this file>
  "git checkout -b symbian origin/symbian" (checkout symbian branch)

  "qmake"
  "make debug-winscw" (for emulator build)
  "make release-gcce" (for phone build)

  "for installable binary (dll):
  "cd src" && "make sis" (after this you should have qjson.sis (sis name varies between Qt versions, 4.6.2 should have name qjson.sis)

  if you want to run for example cmlline_tester then
  cd tests\cmdline_tester
  "qmake"
  "make debug-winscw" and for device "make release-gcce" and "make sis"
